## TGA-MS Quantification Project

This code is used for the quantification of multiple mass traces for a Thermogravimetric Analysis Device (TGA) (TGA/DSC 1, Mettler-Toledo, Switzerland) hyphenated to a Mass Spectrometer (MS) (QMG220, Pfeiffer Vacuum, Germany), utilizing the derivative of the weight signal from the TGA and fitting the mass traces of the MS. The code works with the respective data output from the two devices, but can of course be modifed for slightly different input data.
